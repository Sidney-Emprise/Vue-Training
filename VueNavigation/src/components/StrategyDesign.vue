            <li><strong>Analyze the user's problem and clarify it:&nbsp;</strong>Restate the problem to the user to ensure full understanding,&nbsp;This eliminates assumptions and ensures clarity before proceeding with design</li>

            <li><strong>Document existing elements when redesigning a process:&nbsp;</strong>Investigate the current process,&nbsp;Identify and note any client frustrations to address in the new design</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze data types, tables, and references, and understand their connections:&nbsp;</strong>Use Excel to list data types with field names and types,&nbsp;Use Miro to visualize relationships between tables</li>
            <li><strong>Clarify the role of data types and tables:&nbsp;</strong>Define what populates or calculates fields in the system</li>
            <li><strong>Visualize the developing solution:&nbsp;</strong>Use tools like Miro or Figma to create visual representations of the design,&nbsp;This makes the solution easier for the client and their team to understand,&nbsp;Add notes to the design, display as much information as possible</li>
