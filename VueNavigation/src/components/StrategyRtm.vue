        <ol>
            <li><strong>Categorize the Design</strong>: Start by organizing the design into its most identifiable aspects.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Stories for Full Implementation</strong>: Develop user stories that cover all aspects of the design to ensure complete implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Subtasks for Larger Tasks</strong>: Break down the stories into smaller, manageable subtasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage Miro</strong>: Using a Miro board can speed up the breakdown process by offering a visual, flexible workspace.</li>
            <li><strong>Whiteboard Approach</strong>: The whiteboard method allows for easy reordering, dragging and dropping, or duplicating tasks, making it easier to organize and adjust as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Task Instructions</strong>: Task instructions should be thorough and include all necessary details for developers to implement the feature accurately. Minimize assumptions to ensure the implementation aligns with the design.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Time Estimates</strong>: Time estimates should account for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Development, Peer review, Deployment, Documentation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Identity Dependencies</strong>: If there are any dependencies in the design, be sure to highlight and include them in the task notes for better tracking and clarity.</li>
